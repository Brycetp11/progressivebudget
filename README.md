In this project our goal was to use PWA to enable to app to function offline. In order to achieve this, we had to create a webmanifest file and a service-worker.js file. Each file is fairly boiler-plate, with the only changes being the routes in the files to cache and the fetch route. After that I used the mLab to enable mongodb, and then deployed to master and to heroku.
